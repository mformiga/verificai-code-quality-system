# Executive Summary

The VerificAI Code Quality System is an AI-powered code analysis platform designed for QA teams, built with a modern full-stack architecture. This document provides a comprehensive technical blueprint covering the entire system architecture, from infrastructure to application components.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository for frontend, backend, and shared components
2. **Microservice-ready Design**: Monolithic initial deployment with clear boundaries for future microservices
3. **Event-driven Architecture**: Async processing with WebSocket real-time updates
4. **Multi-LLM Integration**: LangChain-based abstraction layer for provider flexibility
5. **Token Optimization Strategy**: Intelligent processing to minimize LLM costs
6. **Gov.br Design System**: Compliance with Brazilian government standards

### System Overview

The system consists of 5 main screens:
1. **Code Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface for code submission
2. **Prompt Configuration**: Management of three analysis prompt types
3. **General Criteria Analysis**: Code quality assessment
4. **Architectural Compliance Analysis**: Architecture document validation
5. **Business Compliance Analysis**: Business requirements validation
