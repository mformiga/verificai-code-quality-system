# 1. Technical Summary and Patterns

### Architecture Patterns

#### 1.1 Clean Architecture
- **Layers**: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation
- **Dependency Direction**: Outer layers depend on inner layers
- **Domain-driven Design**: Business logic isolated in domain layer

#### 1.2 Event-Driven Architecture
- **Async Processing**: Celery workers for long-running tasks
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for progress tracking
- **Event Sourcing**: Analysis state transitions tracked as events

#### 1.3 CQRS Pattern (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- **Commands**: Write operations (uploads, configurations, analysis starts)
- **Queries**: Read operations (results, status, history)
- **Separate Models**: Optimized read models for reporting

#### 1.4 Strategy Pattern for LLM Integration
- **Provider Abstraction**: Common interface for different LLM providers
- **Runtime Selection**: Dynamic provider switching based on availability/cost
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when providers fail

### Design Patterns Applied

#### 1.5 Repository Pattern
- **Data Access Abstraction**: Clean separation between business logic and data access
- **Testability**: Easy mocking for unit tests
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap data sources

#### 1.6 Factory Pattern
- **Analysis Type Factory**: Creates appropriate analysis handlers based on type
- **LLM Provider Factory**: Instantiates appropriate LLM clients
- **File Processor Factory**: Creates processors for different file types

#### 1.7 Observer Pattern
- **Progress Tracking**: Multiple components observe analysis progress
- **Status Updates**: Real-time notifications via WebSocket
- **State Synchronization**: Frontend components react to backend state changes
